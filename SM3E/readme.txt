-- DESCRIPTION --

SM3E is a A ROM hacking tool for editing Super Metroid. It will feature automatic
management of the data in the ROM, so there is no need to repoint anything manually.


-- AUTHOR'S NOTES --

This is a project I started in the summer of 2017, and was originally written in C++,
using SDL for the user interface. However, since building a UI that way is a pain, I
eventually stopped development. Now that I have started learning C#, and because UI
development with XAML is much easier, I've decided to give it another go. Parts of the 
code have been directly ported, other parts are new.


-- FEATURES --

At the moment, not even all functionality of the original C++ version has been
implemented. For now the program functions as a level viewer for Super Metroid.


-- USAGE --

Should you decide to build the project, make sure to place the contents of Resources.zip 
in the same folder as the executable.
